Please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. I don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that I won't want to accept.

## Submitting Changes


- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. I may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
